#NOTES

1. There is no such thing as data-key attributes. However there is a way to assign your own data attribute by adding a hyphen "-" behind data and then you create something like "data-key"
2. The event.keyCode feature is no longer available. The alternative is either to use event.key or the event.code
3. document.QuerySelector selects a specific element, document.QuerySelectorAll selects all elements
4. <element>.classList.add() adds a class to a list of classes to a specific element
5. <element>.classList.remove() removes a class from a specific element
